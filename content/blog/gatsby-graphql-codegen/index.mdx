title: Setting Up GraphQL Code Generator with Gatsby

For my Gatsby site, I automatically generate the GraphQL query types for TypeScript, with [GraphQL Code Generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/). This tool reads your Gatsby GraphQL schema, parses your code for `graphql` tags in your Gatsby code, then creates TypeScript type definitions for all the GraphQL queries.

Here's how you can set-up GraphQL Code Generator in your own Gatsby site.

## Installing dependencies

First, install GraphQL Code Generator CLI and plugin dependencies from `npm`:

```shell
yarn add -D @graphql-codegen/cli @graphql-codegen/typescript @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations
```

## Configuring the Code Generator

Get your site running locally with `yarn develop`. Here's my terminal output after Gatsby works its site generation magic:

```terminal
You can now view rohan-chandra-personal-website in the browser.
  http://localhost:8000/

View GraphiQL, an in-browser IDE, to explore your site's data and schema
  http://localhost:8000/___graphql

Note that the development build is not optimized.
To create a production build, use gatsby build
```

The ever-helpful Gatsby points us to `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This site allows you to explore your GraphQL data and schema. Here's the important part: GraphQL Code Generator can access this **same URL** to access the GraphQL schema!

Next to your `package.json`, let's create a `codegen.yaml`, with the link to our schema.

```yaml title=./codegen.yaml
overwrite: true
schema: http://localhost:8000/___graphql
documents:
  - ./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}
generates:
  ./src/graphqlTypes.ts:
    plugins:
      - typescript
      - typescript-operations
    config:
      avoidOptionals: true
      maybeValue: "T"
      namingConvention:
        enumValues: "keep"
# Uncomment to reformat with types prettier.
#   hooks:
#     afterOneFileWrite:
#       - prettier --write
```

## Running the Code Generator

With our code generation config set-up, let's head to the `scripts` section of `package.json`. Add in:

```json title=./package.json
"scripts": {
  "codegen": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.yaml",
  "codegen:watch": "graphql-codegen --config codegen.yaml --watch"
}
```

Here's the fun part. Make sure your Gatsby site is running locally with `yarn develop`, then (in another terminal) run `graphql-codegen`:

```shell
yarn codegen
```

In `./src/graphqlTypes.ts`, you'll see your generated types. Here's what the first couple of lines look like:

```typescript
export type Maybe<T> = T;
export type Exact<T extends { [key: string]: unknown }> = {
  [K in keyof T]: T[K];
};
```

I know what you're thinking: `yarn codegen` **every** time I write a new GraphQL query? ðŸ˜¢ Thankfully, with the `--watch` flag (in the second script we added above), we can regenerate types whenever the code changes:

```shell
yarn codegen:watch
```

## Examples

The code generator parses the `graphql` tag and uses the query name as the type name.

Let's walkthough two examples to see this in action. You'll want `yarn develop` and `yarn codegen:watch` running in two terminals, if you'd like to follow along.

### Static Query Hook Example

Here's an example of using the static query hook from Gatsby. I have my Gatsby site running (with `yarn develop`, which makes the GraphQL schema accessible) and the code generator keeping an eye on any new code (`yarn codegen:watch`).

Create a file of `./src/pages/codegen.tsx` with the below code. Now, visit `http://localhost:8000/codegen` to checkout your new page.

```tsx title=./src/pages/codegen.tsx
import React from "react";
import { graphql, useStaticQuery } from "gatsby";
import { DemoQuery } from "-/graphqlTypes";

const CodegenPage: React.FC = () => {
  const data = useStaticQuery<DemoQuery>(graphql`
    query Demo {
      site {
        siteMetadata {
          title
        }
      }
    }
  `);

  return (
    <>
      <p>{data.site.siteMetadata.title}</p>
    </>
  );
};

export default CodegenPage;
```

Pay special attention to the query name: the generated type is `DemoQuery`, as I named the query "`Demo`". The generated types are in `-/graphqlTypes`, which can be auto-imported in VS Code (or your editor of choice):

```tsx
import { DemoQuery } from "-/graphqlTypes";
```

Other than these two changes, the GraphQL querying code looks like it normally would.

### Page Query Example

Let's also use try a page query. Again, I have my Gatsby site running with `yarn develop`, while the code generator runs in the background (`yarn codegen:watch`).

Create `./src/pages/codegen.tsx` with the following code:

```tsx title=./src/pages/codegen.tsx
import React from "react";
import { graphql } from "gatsby";
import { DemoQuery } from "-/graphqlTypes";

interface Props {
  data: DemoQuery;
}

const CodegenPage: React.FC<Props> = ({ data }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <p>{data.site.siteMetadata.title}</p>
    </>
  );
};

export const query = graphql`
  query Demo {
    site {
      siteMetadata {
        title
      }
    }
  }
`;

export default CodegenPage;
```

All the concepts are the same as the hook version. `DemoQuery` is generated for us as the query is named `Demo`, which we can then use in our prop types. Sweet!
